# Analytics Enhancements - Testing Guide

## Quick Verification Steps

Follow these steps to verify all three enhancements are working correctly.

## 🎯 Test 1: Exit Cap Rate Input Field

### Steps:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/analytics`
2. Select the "Sensitivity Analysis" tab (should be default)
3. Look at the left column "📊 Assumptions Panel"
4. Scroll down to find the new **"Exit Cap Rate"** input field (should be the last field)

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Exit Cap Rate field is visible
- ✅ Default value is `5.0%`
- ✅ Tooltip appears on hover explaining the formula
- ✅ Field accepts decimal inputs (try 4.5, 5.5, 6.0)

### Test the Functionality:
1. Note the current "Year 10 Total Equity" value in the Baseline Forecast chart
2. Change Exit Cap Rate from 5.0% to 6.0%
3. Watch the "Year 10 Total Equity" value update in real-time
4. Lower Exit Cap Rate = Higher Sale Price = Higher Equity
5. Higher Exit Cap Rate = Lower Sale Price = Lower Equity

**Why this matters:** The Exit Cap Rate now determines the future sale price using the formula: `Sale Price = NOI ÷ Cap Rate`, which is more realistic than simple appreciation.

## 📈 Test 2: Mortgage Balance Line in Chart

### Steps:
1. Stay on the "Sensitivity Analysis" tab
2. Look at the "📈 Baseline Forecast (10 Years)" chart
3. Identify the three lines in the chart

### Expected Results:
- ✅ **Green line** - Net Cash Flow (should be relatively flat)
- ✅ **Red line** - Mortgage Balance (should decline over time)
- ✅ **Blue line** - Total Equity (should increase over time)

### Verify the Data:
1. Hover over Year 1 on the red line
   - Should show a high mortgage balance
2. Hover over Year 10 on the red line
   - Should show a lower mortgage balance
3. Look at the "Year 10 Mortgage Balance" summary card below the chart
   - Should match the Year 10 point on the red line

**Why this matters:** This shows the complete capital stack evolution - how much debt is being paid down while equity grows.

## ⚖️ Test 3: Break-Even Analysis Section

### Steps:
1. Scroll down on the analytics page
2. Find the new "⚖️ Break-Even Analysis" section
3. It should appear below the "🎯 Sensitivity Analysis Dashboard"

### Expected Results:

#### Main Metric Card (Blue gradient):
- ✅ Shows "Cash Flow Break-Even Vacancy Rate" as a large percentage
- ✅ Includes explanation text
- ✅ Percentage is calculated correctly (typically 40-80% for most properties)

#### Comparison Grid:
- ✅ **Left card:** Shows "Current Vacancy Assumption" (typically 0-5%)
- ✅ **Right card:** Shows "Safety Margin" with color coding:
  - Green = Low Risk (>20% margin)
  - Yellow = Moderate Risk (10-20% margin)
  - Red = High Risk (<10% margin)

#### Risk Assessment:
- ✅ Shows appropriate risk level based on safety margin
- ✅ Provides contextual advice and recommendations
- ✅ Icon changes based on risk level

#### Educational Section:
- ✅ Click "How is this calculated?" to expand
- ✅ Shows the formula with actual dollar amounts
- ✅ Lists all three components:
  - Potential Gross Income
  - Operating Expenses
  - Debt Service

### Test the Calculation:
To verify the calculation is correct, you can manually check:

```
Break-Even Vacancy Rate = (Operating Expenses + Debt Service) / Potential Gross Income

Example with Richmond property (typical values):
- Potential Gross Income: $2,150 × 12 = $25,800/year
- Operating Expenses: ~$550 × 12 = $6,600/year
- Debt Service: ~$1,089 × 12 = $13,068/year
- Break-Even Rate: ($6,600 + $13,068) / $25,800 = 76.2%

This means the property can be vacant 76.2% of the year before breaking even!
```

**Why this matters:** This immediately shows how much cushion exists before the property becomes cash flow negative - a critical risk metric.

## 🔄 Integration Test: Change All Three Together

### Steps:
1. In the Assumptions Panel, change:
   - Exit Cap Rate to 6.0%
   - Vacancy Rate to 10.0%
   - Annual Rent Increase to 3.0%

2. Observe changes across all components:
   - ✅ Baseline Forecast chart updates
   - ✅ Sensitivity Analysis Dashboard shows new metrics
   - ✅ Break-Even Analysis recalculates

3. Click "Reset to Defaults" button
   - ✅ All values return to defaults
   - ✅ All charts and metrics update accordingly

---

## 🌓 Test 4: Dark Mode Support

### Steps:
1. Toggle dark mode (if available in your app)
2. Verify all three new features display correctly in dark mode

### Expected Results:
- ✅ All text is readable
- ✅ Gradients and backgrounds adapt to dark theme
- ✅ Chart colors remain visible and distinct
- ✅ No white boxes or contrast issues

---

## 📱 Test 5: Responsive Design

### Steps:
1. Resize browser window to mobile width (< 768px)
2. Check all three components

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Assumptions Panel stacks properly
- ✅ Chart remains readable and scrollable
- ✅ Break-Even Analysis cards stack vertically
- ✅ All text and buttons remain accessible

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Exit Cap Rate field not showing
**Solution:** Check that you're on the "Sensitivity Analysis" tab, not "Scenarios" or "Portfolio"

### Issue: Break-Even Analysis shows "Select a property"
**Solution:** Make sure a property is selected in the dropdown at the top of the page

### Issue: Chart not updating when changing assumptions
**Solution:** 
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify all properties have valid mortgage data

### Issue: Calculation seems incorrect
**Solution:**
- Expand "How is this calculated?" in Break-Even Analysis
- Verify all property data is correct (rent, expenses, mortgage)
- Check that mortgage payment calculation is working

## 🎉 Success Criteria

All tests pass if:
- ✅ Exit Cap Rate field is visible and functional
- ✅ Mortgage Balance (red line) appears in the chart
- ✅ Break-Even Analysis section displays with correct calculations
- ✅ All components update dynamically when assumptions change
- ✅ Dark mode works correctly
- ✅ Responsive design works on mobile
- ✅ No console errors in browser developer tools
