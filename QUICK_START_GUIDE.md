## 📊 What You Can Do

### Adjust Assumptions ⚙️
Move sliders or type numbers to change:
- **Rent Growth** - How fast rents increase
- **Expense Growth** - How fast costs increase  
- **Property Value** - How fast property appreciates
- **Vacancy** - How much vacant time to expect
- **Interest Rate** - What rate you'll pay on renewal

**Hover over (?)** for explanation of each input!

### View Baseline Forecast 📈
See your property's projected performance over 10 years:
- 🟢 **Green Line** = Cash flow you'll earn
- 🔴 **Red Line** = Mortgage balance remaining
- 🔵 **Blue Line** = Equity you'll build

### Compare Scenarios 🎯
See three key metrics side-by-side:
1. **10-Year IRR** - Your annualized return
2. **Average Cash Flow** - Income per year
3. **Total Profit** - Gain if you sell in year 10

**Colors tell the story:**
- 🟢 Green = Better than baseline
- 🔴 Red = Worse than baseline
- ⚪ Gray = About the same

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Create Three Scenarios
For each property, create:
- **Optimistic** - Best case (high rent growth, low vacancy)
- **Realistic** - Most likely (moderate assumptions)
- **Conservative** - Worst case (low growth, high vacancy)

This shows your range of potential outcomes!

### Tip 2: Test One Variable at a Time
Want to understand impact of rent growth?
1. Save "Baseline" 
2. Change ONLY rent increase
3. Save "High Rent Growth"
4. Load baseline, change ONLY rent decrease
5. Save "Low Rent Growth"
6. Compare all three!

### Tip 3: Model Your Renewal
Mortgage renewal coming up?
1. Set future interest rate to your current rate
2. Save as "Same Rate Renewal"
3. Set future rate to expected market rate
4. Save as "Market Rate Renewal"
5. See the cash flow impact!

### Tip 4: Use Descriptive Names
✅ Good: "Conservative Q1 2025"  
✅ Good: "Post-Rate-Cut Optimistic"  
✅ Good: "5% Rent Growth Scenario"  

❌ Bad: "Scenario 1"  
❌ Bad: "Test"  
❌ Bad: "New"

## 🎓 Understanding the Metrics

### IRR (Internal Rate of Return)
**What it is:** Your annualized return over 10 years  
**Why it matters:** Compares to other investments  
**Good vs Bad:** 
- 🟢 8%+ = Excellent
- 🟡 5-8% = Good
- 🔴 <5% = Below target

### Average Annual Cash Flow
**What it is:** Mean yearly income after all expenses  
**Why it matters:** Your ongoing cash in pocket  
**Good vs Bad:**
- 🟢 Positive = Property pays you
- 🔴 Negative = You pay property

### Total Profit at Sale
**What it is:** Total gain if sold at year 10  
**Why it matters:** Your wealth creation  
**Formula:** Equity + Cumulative Cash - Investment

### Scenario: "What if we hit a recession?"
- Rent Increase: **1%** (vs 2%)
- Vacancy Rate: **10%** (vs 5%)
- Expense Inflation: **3.5%** (vs 2.5%)
- See: Lower cash flow, understand downside risk

### Scenario: "What if I improve efficiency?"
- Expense Inflation: **1.5%** (vs 2.5%)
- See: Significant cash flow improvement!

### Scenario: "What if rates spike?"
- Future Interest Rate: **7%** (vs 5%)
- See: Impact on cash flow after renewal

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Overly Optimistic
❌ Setting rent growth at 10%/year  
✅ Use realistic 2-4% based on market data

### Mistake 2: Ignoring Vacancy
❌ Setting vacancy to 0%  
✅ Use at least 5% to be safe

### Mistake 3: Forgetting Expense Inflation
❌ Assuming costs stay flat  
✅ Remember: Property tax, insurance, maintenance all increase

### Mistake 4: Not Saving Scenarios
❌ Adjusting and forgetting what you tested  
✅ Save each scenario for future reference
